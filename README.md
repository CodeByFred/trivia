## MVP

- [ ] When the user completes a quiz, it gets submitted to the API that keeps track of all game details:
  - [ ] Score
  - [ ] Date played
  - [ ] Questions answered
  - [ ] Submitted answer for each question
  - [ ] Correct answer for each question
  - [ ] If a question was failed or not
- [ ] One of the API endpoints should allow filtering questions by failed
- [ ] On the frontend, the user should be able to view questions that they answered wrong
- [ ] They should be able to attempt those questions again
- [ ] If they answer the question correctly, it should get archived in the database
