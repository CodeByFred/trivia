# Trivia UI

## Introduction

**Task:** Create an app that will allow users to play trivia and display a score at the end of each game.

**Techstack:** React + Typescript.

**API calls:**

- Questions will be fetched from [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/).
- User progress will be tracked using the [Trivia Quiz Progress API](https://github.com/nology-tech/aus-post-course-guide/tree/main/projects/trivia-api).

## MVP

- [ ] Create an interface that allows a user to choose the level of difficulty and start a new game (Fred)
- [ ] When the game starts, display a question card with 4 possible answers (Carrie)
- [ ] If the user answers the question correctly, show a new question
- [ ] If the answer is incorrect, end the game
- [ ] Display the score (number of questions answered correctly) at the end of each game
- [ ] Add a "Play Again" button under the score

## Bonus

- [ ] Allow the user to select a category of questions
- [ ] Add a time countdown to each question; if a question is not answered before time is up, end the game
